## About the app:
This site, developed in React, is a living portfolio showcasing my progress, challenges, and successes as I deepen my understanding of Front-End development. Throughout the course, I've applied what I've learned, and I've also explored topics beyond the curriculum, such as routing and tools like Tailwindcss. Here, you'll find examples of labs, projects, and practice exercises, all demonstrating key concepts and techniques.

I wanted to practice the things I was learning from all of these courses and I didn't want to get rusty with my current skills. After feeling dissatisfied with leaving my work in repos I came up with this idea. It presents its own unique challenges such as how to organize the content, routing, and what would be a good user experience for someone who wants to see what I have been up to. It's also a fun sandbox for me to express some of my ideas and creativity.

### The skills I learned after completing this project:
- More practice with React functional components and their reusability
- More practice with React file and folder structure
- React routing
- More practice with Tailwind CSS
- More practice with Fundamental CSS properties to master flex
- More practice with animations
- Layout and UI/UX
  
## Technologies:
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Components styled with [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Setup:
Clone the project and enter its root directory.

Install **Node.js** -> [Instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs)

### `npm i`
Installs all of the project's dependencies.

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Approach: 
This project wasn't planned and has been developed organically. I started a basic React app and built the layout/navigation. I figured I would display different pages for the content. As I added more content, the layout/navigation changed, and how I displayed content changed. As I have more ideas and more needs/challenges I will adapt the site. Normally I have a plan and know what I want before I start a project but I like and will continue to develop this site based on need and inspiration. 

## Status:
This project is in development.
